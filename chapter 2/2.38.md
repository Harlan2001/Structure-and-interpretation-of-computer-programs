## exercise 2.38

```Scheme
#lang racket

(define (fold-right op initial sequence)
  (if (null? sequence)
      initial
      (op (car sequence)
          (fold-right op initial (cdr sequence)))))

(define (fold-left op initial sequence)
  (define (iter result rest)
    (if (null? rest)
        result
        (iter (op result (car rest))
              (cdr rest))))
  (iter initial sequence))

;;;;;;;;;;;;;
(fold-right / 1 (list 1 2 3))
(fold-left / 1 (list 1 2 3))
(fold-right list null (list 1 2 3))
(fold-left list null (list 1 2 3))
(fold-right cons null (list 1 2 3))
(fold-left cons null (list 1 2 3))
(fold-left (lambda (x y) (cons y x)) null (list 1 2 3))
```

For op to guarantee that fold-right and fold-left have the same effect on any sequence, op must have the commutative law.So op x y is the same thing as op y x.

For example, addition (+) or multiplication (*), and or, are commutative.The fold-right and the fold-left are evaluated the same.
