                (map (lambda (rest-of-queens)
                      (adjoin-position new-row k rest-of-queens))

Louis wrote the program like this.Write the time-consuming recursive calculation queen-cols inside the loop.Therefore, board-size was double computed (queen-cols (-k 1))).
Assuming that the original time is T and the board-size is repeated, the time seems to be board-size * T.
But wait, the calculation of (queen-cols k) doubled the board-size multiple times (queen-cols (-k 1)).However, when calculating (queen-cols (-k 1)), the board-size times (queen-cols (-k 2)) were also repeated, so the time of calculating (queen-cols (-k 1)) itself was also slow.
More generally, when calculating (queen-cols 1), the board-size is repeated several times, which is a times slower than the board-size.In the calculation (queen-cols 2), the board-size was also repeatedly calculated (queen-cols 1), so it was stacked up to slow the board-size ^ 2 times.When we compute (queen-cols 3), it adds up to be slower by a factor of board-size ^ 3.
So queen-cols board-size, it's going to be slower board-size ^ board-size.
Therefore, assuming that the original problem takes time T, Louis wrote the time-consuming recursive calculation inside the loop, it takes time (board-size ^ board-size) * T.For the eight queens problem, you need to use when (8 ^ 8) * T = 823543 * T.
