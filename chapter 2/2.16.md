## exercise 2.16

In interval calculation, every data can be any value within the error range.Like when A

```
A = [19.6, 20.4]
```

When you want to compute A/A.Each time you pick A, you can pick a different, independent number.For example, the first A is 19.6, and the second A is 20.4.So the calculation result 'A/A = 1.0408163265306', is not equal to 1.

Each interval value is independent, resulting in the calculation of the interval does not meet the ordinary algebraic law.'A/A ≠ 1', 'A(B + C) ≠ AB + AC'.

To solve this problem, the interval arithmetic package.In addition to containing the numeric value of the interval itself, you also need to have some sort of "identity" information.When you calculate the formula A/A, you need to recognize that these two A's are the same, and simplify directly.

For example, an interval can be recorded as A triplet of information, with the first data "A" being the identity information.

```
A = ("A", 19.6, 20.4)
```

When A/A is calculated, it is obtained from the identity information that the two are the same, then the symbol calculation is carried out directly, and the obtained result is recorded as

```
A/A = ((/ "A" "A") 1 1)
```

The above is just one way to construct the identity of the interval; there should be other ways.Each interval calculation, through the "identity" information, according to certain algebraic rules, to simplify the formula, the final result.
