;; P93 - [练习 2.49]

;; a) 画出给定框架边界的画家
;; 这里将 0.99 写成 1, 会显示不完整
(define frame-painter
  (segments->painter (list (make-segment (make-vect 0 0) (make-vect 0 0.99))

                           (make-segment (make-vect 0.99 0) (make-vect 0 0)))))

;; a) 连接框架两对角画出一个大交叉的画家
(define cross-painter
  (segments->painter (list (make-segment (make-vect 0 0) (make-vect 1 1))
                           (make-segment (make-vect 0 1) (make-vect 1 0)))))

;; c) 连接各边的中点，画出一个菱形的画家
(define diamond-painter
  (segments->painter (list (make-segment (make-vect 0.0 0.5) (make-vect 0.5 1.0))
                           (make-segment (make-vect 0.5 1.0) (make-vect 1.0 0.5))
