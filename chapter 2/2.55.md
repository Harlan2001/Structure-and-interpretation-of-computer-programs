## exercise 2.55

As mentioned in the notes on page P97, 'a 'is just a short way of saying (quote a).Therefore

``` Scheme
(car ''abracadabra)
```

Actually equivalent to

``` Scheme
(car (quote (quote abracadabra)))
```

The above form may not be obvious.Expand only one quote and leave the other quote.It can also be written as

``` Scheme
(car '(quote abracadabra))
```

So car is used to fetch the first element in the table, which prints out quote.
