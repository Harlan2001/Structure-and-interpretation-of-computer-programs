## exercise 2.14

Lem is right. Here's the code:
```Scheme
(define (part1 r1 r2)
  (div-interval (mul-interval r1 r2)
                (add-interval r1 r2)))

(define (part2 r1 r2)
  (let ((one (make-interval 1 1)))
    (div-interval one
                  (add-interval (div-interval one r1)
                                (div-interval one r2)))))

(define A (make-center-percent 20 2))
(define B (make-center-percent 10 2))

(print-interval A)
(print-interval B)
(print-interval (part1 A B))
(print-interval (part2 A B))
(print-interval (div-interval A A))
(print-interval (div-interval A B))
```

In the code,
```
A = [19.6, 20.4]
B = [9.8, 10.2]
```

calculation
```
(part1 A B) = [6.277124183006538, 7.077551020408162]
(part2 A B) = [6.533333333333334, 6.799999999999999]
```
As you can see, the results of part1 and part2 are different. part2 has a narrower range and is a better estimate.


And you can see that
```
A / A = [0.9607843137254903, 1.040816326530612]
A / B = [1.9215686274509807, 2.081632653061224]
```
In theory, A/A should be exact [1, 1], but in practice it will be slightly different.
