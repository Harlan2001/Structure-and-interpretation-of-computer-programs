## exercise 2.77

This problem can be modified and verified on the basis of the code of general arithmetic operations.
The following code creates object z in Figure 2-24

``` Scheme
(define z (make-complex-from-real-imag 3 4))
z
```

In DrRacket, the following information is displayed
``` Scheme
'(complex rectangular 3 . 4)
```

equals to 

``` Scheme
(cons 'complex (cons 'rectangular (cons 3 4)))
```

As you can see, there are two layers of type-tag nesting.First, type-tag was complex, then nested type-tag was rectangular.

If you haven't already called (put 'magnitude '(complex) magnitude), call (magnitude z).Will call in turn

``` Scheme
(magnitude z)
(magnitude '(complex rectangular 3 . 4))
(apply-generic 'magnitude '(complex rectangular 3 . 4))
(get 'magnitude (map type-tag '((complex rectangular 3 . 4))))
(get 'magnitude '(complex))
```

In this case (get 'magnitude '(complex)) is #f.This triggers an error message in apply-generic.

```
No method for these types -- APPLY-GENERIC (magnitude (complex))
```

--------

If we add (put 'magnitude '(complex) magnitude) to the complex installation package function install-complex-package, we can trace the function calls
``` Scheme
(magnitude z)
(magnitude '(complex rectangular 3 . 4))
(apply-generic 'magnitude '(complex rectangular 3 . 4))
(get 'magnitude '(complex))
(apply magnitude (map contents '((complex rectangular 3 . 4))))

(magnitude '(rectangular 3 . 4))
(apply-generic 'magnitude '(rectangular 3 . 4))
(get 'magnitude '(rectangular))
(apply magnitude-rectangular (map contents '((rectangular 3 . 4))))
(magnitude-rectangular '(3 . 4))
5
```

In the above function call.Magnitude-rectangular refers to the magnitude function defined in install-rectangular-package, which is recorded as magnitude-rectangular in order to avoid the misdirection of the same name.

You can see that apply-generic is called twice.

One is to assign to (get 'magnitude '(complex))

The other time was assigned to (get 'magnitude '(rectangular)).
