I think user Eva Lu Ator is right.See Exercise 2.14 for test results.when
A = [19.6, 20.4]
B = [9.8, 10.2]
part1 and part2 compare the two.part2 has a narrower range and gives a better estimate of the range.
In interval calculation, every data can be any value within the error range.
Each calculation causes the error value to spread, so the fewer errors occur, the more compact the result will be.
