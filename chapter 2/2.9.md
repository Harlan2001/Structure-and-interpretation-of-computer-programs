## exercise 2.9

Let's say that the upper and lower bounds of a are ua and la. the width is wag. The upper and lower bounds of b are the same and the lb0, the width is wb. So you have

```
Wa = (Ua - La) / 2
Wb = (Ub - Lb) / 2
```

The two intervals of the aand b are added, and the result is cels.

```
c = [La, Ua] + [Lb, Ub] = [La + Lb, Ua + Ub]
```

So the width of c

```
Wc = [(Ua + Ub) - (La + Lb)] / 2 = [(Ua - La) / 2] + [(Ub - Lb) / 2] = Wa + Wb
```

------
Similarly, if you subtract a from b, you get d.

```
d = [La, Ua] - [Lb, Ub] = [La - Ub, Ua - Lb]
```

So the width of d

```
Wd = [(Ua - Lb) - (La - Ub)] / 2 = [(Ua - La) / 2] - [(Ub - Lb) / 2] = Wa - Wb
```

---
Multiplication and division are not.For example

* a = [10, 20]，width Wa = 5
* b = [1, 5]，width Wb = 2

When the interval a and b are multiplied, the result is [10, 100], and the width is 45, which is not equal to Wa * Wb.

When the interval a and b are divided, the result is [2, 20] and the width is 9, which is not equal to Wa/Wb.
