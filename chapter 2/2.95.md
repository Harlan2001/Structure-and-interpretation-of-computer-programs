On the code from Exercise 2.94, add the following statement:
``` Scheme
(define P1  (make-polynomial 'x '((2 1) (1 -2) (0 1))))
(define P2  (make-polynomial 'x '((2 11) (0 7))))
(define P3  (make-polynomial 'x '((1 13) (0 5))))

(define Q1 (mul P1 P2))
(define Q2 (mul P1 P3))

(print-poly "gcd(Q1,Q2)" (greatest-common-divisor Q1 Q2))The output is
``` 

``` 
gcd(Q1,Q2)
(polynomial x (2 1458/169) (1 -2916/169) (0 1458/169))
(1458/169*x^2 + (-2916/169)*x + 1458/169)
``` 

Comparing the infix expression of gcd(Q1,Q2) and P1, there is
``` 
gcd(Q1,Q2): 1458/169*x^2 + (-2916/169)*x + 1458/169
P1:         x^2 + (-2)*x + 1
``` 

Q1 and Q2 for GCD, compared with P1, are more complicated, each term has an extra fraction of 1458/169.

To understand the reason for this score, you can print some debugging information in gcd-terms with the output as.

``` 
call gcd-terms
a: ((4 11) (3 -22) (2 18) (1 -14) (0 7))
b: ((3 13) (2 -21) (1 3) (0 5))

call gcd-terms
a: ((3 13) (2 -21) (1 3) (0 5))
b: ((2 1458/169) (1 -2916/169) (0 1458/169))

call gcd-terms
a: ((2 1458/169) (1 -2916/169) (0 1458/169))
b: ()
``` 

Among them
* `((4 11) (3 -22) (2 18) (1 -14) (0 7))` is (term-list Q1)
* `((3 13) (2 -21) (1 3) (0 5))` is (term-list Q2)

As you can see, gcd-terms is called three times.On the second call, the b argument already has a fraction.The b argument on the second call is the same argument on the first call

``` Scheme
(remainder-terms a b)
``` 

To do this, we use div-terms to print the output of a, b, and div
```
a:   ((4 11) (3 -22) (2 18) (1 -14) (0 7))
b:   ((3 13) (2 -21) (1 3) (0 5))
a/b: ((1 11/13) (0 -55/169))
a%b: ((2 1458/169) (1 -2916/169) (0 1458/169))
```
Ival-terms is used to find the remainder of a polynomial.The remainder is defined using a - b * (a/b).If quotient a/b has a fraction, the remainder will naturally have a fraction.
Observe that the fraction 11/13 appears in the first term of the quotient.Analyze the div-terms code, when L1, L2 first item appears in the code
* t1 = (4 11), indicating order = 4 and coeff = 11
* t2 = (3 13), which means order = 3 and coeff = 13
div-terms has these two lines for order and coeff for the new item
``` Scheme
(new-c (div (coeff t1) (coeff t2)))
(new-o (- (order t1) (order t2)))
```
The evaluation procedure of the following expression is
``` Scheme
(new-c (div (coeff t1) (coeff t2)))
(new-c (div 11 13))
(new-c (/ 11 13))
(new-c 11/13)
``` 
So we know why the scores are there.In Scheme, when two integers are evaluated using /, an exact fraction (rational number) is obtained.
