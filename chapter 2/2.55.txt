As mentioned in the notes on page P97, 'a 'is just a short way of saying (quote a).Therefore
(car ''abracadabra)
Actually equivalent to
(car (quote (quote abracadabra)))
The above form may not be obvious.Expand only one quote and leave the other quote.It can also be written as
(car '(quote abracadabra))
So car is used to fetch the first element in the table, which prints out quote.
