# mit-6.001
This may include my learning note and my solvement of the exercise
I have already read the book SCIP in my freshman year, but i still decide to read it again and finish all the exercise. And the lesson i am learing is the mit 6.001 (1986)
Besides, i decide to write the journal of the process that i learn everyday.
Not only for the record of learning, but also as a journal for imporving my english persentation
I usually read blogs on CSDN and github. but i don't usually write anything or share my code on any internet forum. I guess i am too shy and afraid of being judged or commented by others.
Also maybe i will write something personal in the journal to share it with my classmates and friends on github 
Ultimately, when i read those things after colleage, i can still recall these beautiful memories
Thank you
