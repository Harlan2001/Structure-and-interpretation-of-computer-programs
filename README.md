# mit-6.001
This may include my learning note and my solvement of the exercise.

I have already read the book SCIP in my freshman year, but i still decide to read it again and finish all the exercise. And the lesson i am learing is the mit 6.001 (1986).

I write the code on DrRocket, and for most literal part i use the transilation tool to translate the chinese into english, i have checked most of them, but still there may be some faults in it because of my poor english, sorry about that.  

Besides, i decide to write the journal of the process that i learn everyday.Not only for the record of learning, but also as a journal for imporving my english expression.

I usually read blogs on CSDN and github. but i don't usually write anything or share my code on any internet forum. I guess i am too shy and afraid of being judged or commented by others.

Also maybe i will write something personal in the journal to share it with my classmates and friends on github.

Ultimately, when i read those things after colleage, i can still recall these beautiful memories
Thank you
