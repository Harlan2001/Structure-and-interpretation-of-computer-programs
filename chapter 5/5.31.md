## exercise 5.31

### a)

``` Scheme
(f 'x 'y)
```

There is no need to save or restore any registers.

### b)

``` Scheme
((f) 'x 'y)
```

There is also no need to save or restore any registers.

### c)

``` Scheme
(f (g 'x) y)
```

The proc and argl registers are used to evaluate `(g 'x)`. Thus proc and argl need to save and restore.

The environment register, env, needs to be considered in two cases.If the parameters are evaluated from left to right, evaluate first

``` Scheme
(g 'x) 
y
```

In this case, env also needs to save and restore.

If the parameters are evaluated from right to left, evaluate first

``` Scheme
y
(g 'x) 
```
In this case, env does not need to be protected.

Conclusion:

1. If the parameters are evaluated from left to right, save and restore the three registers: proc, argl, and env.
2. If the parameters are evaluated in right-to-left order, save and restore the two registers: proc and argl.

### d)

``` Scheme
(f (g 'x) 'y)
```

Two registers need to be saved and restore: proc and argl.There is no need to protect the environment register env.
