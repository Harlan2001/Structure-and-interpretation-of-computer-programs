## exercise 5.6

In afterfib-n-1, `(restore continue)` and `(save continue)` can be removed.

``` Scheme
afterfib-n-1
  (restore n)
  (restore continue) ;; can be removed
  (assign n (op -) (reg n) (const 2))
  (save continue)    ;; can be removed
  (assign continue (label afterfib-n-2))
  (save val)
  (goto (label fib-loop))
```

These two instructions remove continue from the stack and push it back in.
