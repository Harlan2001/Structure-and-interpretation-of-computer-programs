## exercise 5.8

### a)

When the controller reaches there, the contents of register a are 3.

When the assembler processes instructions, it calls `extract-labels`to store labels in sequence.Then lookup-label is called in order.That is, if two labels have the same name, the first occurrence of the label is referenced.

So `(goto (label here))` jumps to the following instruction, and the contents of register a are changed to 3.

``` Scheme
here
  (assign a (const 3))
  (goto (label there))
```

### b)

Based on [ch5-regsim.scm](./ch5-regsim.scm), modify `extract-labels` to:

``` Scheme
(define (extract-labels text receive)
  (if (null? text)
      (receive '() '())
      (extract-labels 
        (cdr text)
        (lambda (insts labels)
          (let ((next-inst (car text)))
            (if (symbol? next-inst)
                ;;Add judgment here to identify duplicate labels
                (if (assoc next-inst labels)
                    (error "The label has existed EXTRACT-LABELS" next-inst)
                    (receive insts
                             (cons (make-label-entry next-inst insts)
                                   labels)))
                (receive (cons (make-instruction next-inst) insts)
                         labels)))))))
```
