## exercise 4.66

### a)

As shown in [exercise 4.65](./4.65.md) the query results can be repeated.For example, in the query result of  `(wheel ?who)` 的查询结果中，`Warbucks Oliver`appears multiple times.Accordingly, let's go to query the salary statement

``` Scheme
(and (wheel ?who) (salary ?who ?amount))
```

The result is

``` Scheme
(and (wheel (Warbucks Oliver)) (salary (Warbucks Oliver) 150000))
(and (wheel (Warbucks Oliver)) (salary (Warbucks Oliver) 150000))
(and (wheel (Bitdiddle Ben)) (salary (Bitdiddle Ben) 60000))
(and (wheel (Warbucks Oliver)) (salary (Warbucks Oliver) 150000))
(and (wheel (Warbucks Oliver)) (salary (Warbucks Oliver) 150000))
```

Warbucks Oliver salary results also appear multiple times.Assuming that statistical functions such as sum and average have been implemented, the following statistical statements are given

``` Scheme
(sum ?amount 
     (and (wheel ?who) 
          (salary ?who ?amount)))
```

This is going to run Warbucks Oliver's salary multiple times.This is not the right result.

### b)

You can add a  statement for removing the duplicate to the query system, such as one named distinct. Write the above statistical wage statement as

``` Scheme
(sum ?amount 
     (and (distinct (wheel ?who))
          (salary ?who ?amount)))
```
