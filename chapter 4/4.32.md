## exercise 4.32

### a)

The lazy table implemented in this section can be evaluated lazily even with the first element in the table, car.In the flow implemented in Chapter 3, the first element is the one that needs to be evaluated immediately.

For example, in [exercise 4.18](./exercise_4_18.md) rewrite  `solve` as:

``` Scheme
(define (solve f y0 dt)
  (let ((y '*unassigned*)
        (dy '*unassigned*))
    (let ((a (integral (delay dy) y0 dt))
          (b (stream-map f y)))
      (set! y a)
      (set! dy b))
    y))
```

`(stream-map f y)` needs to evaluate the first element of y immediately in the stream.So an error occurs.

And the corresponding version of the lazy table implementation:

``` Scheme
(define (solve f y0 dt)
  (let ((y '*unassigned*)
        (dy '*unassigned*))
    (let ((a (integral dy y0 dt))
          (b (map f y)))
      (set! y a)
      (set! dy b))
    y))
```   

It can be evaluated normally.In the lazy table, the first element of `(map f y)` is also evaluated deferred.

### b)

The first element of the lazy table is also lazy, and we can modify the entire sequence by changing the initial value in the table.For example, the library has a pre-written sequence of random numbers

``` Scheme
(define random-init 7)
(define random-numbers
  (cons random-init
        (map rand-update random-numbers)))
```

This sequence of random numbers, by default, is initialized with a value of 7.Sometimes we want to set another initial value when we use it.You can write it like this

``` Scheme
(set! random-init 100)
(list-ref random-numbers 10)
```

The user can set the initial value for different purposes.
