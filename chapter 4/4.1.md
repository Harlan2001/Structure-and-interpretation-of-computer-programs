## exericse

Start by writing a little bit of test code,

``` Scheme
(define (f a)
  (display a)
  (newline)
  a)

(+ (f 1) (f 2) (f 3))
```

Slightly modify the `list-of-values` function in [mceval.scm](./mceval.scm). After running, paste the above test code into the input.

If the parameters 1, 2, 3 are printed in turn, it means that  `list-of-values` is evaluated from left to right.If the parameters 3, 2, 1 are printed, it means' list-of-values' evaluated from right to left.

### Evaluate it from left to right

``` Scheme
(define (list-of-values exps env)
  (if (no-operands? exps)
      '()
      (let ((first (eval (first-operand exps) env)))
        (cons first (list-of-values (rest-operands exps) env)))))
```

### Evaluate it from right to left

``` Scheme
(define (list-of-values exps env)
  (if (no-operands? exps)
      '()
      (let ((rest (list-of-values (rest-operands exps) env)))
        (cons (eval (first-operand exps) env) rest))))
```

#### details

Notice above that only one variable, first or rest, is defined in the let statement.If written in the following form, let defines two variables.

``` Scheme
(define (list-of-values exps env)
  (if (no-operands? exps)
      '()
      (let ((first (eval (first-operand exps) env))
            (rest (list-of-values (rest-operands exps) env)))
        (cons first rest))))
```

first and rest also depend on the order in which let's parameters are evaluated, and may not be determined.
