## exercise 4.74

### a)

``` Scheme
(define (simple-stream-flatmap proc s)
  (simple-flatten (stream-map proc s)))

(define (simple-flatten stream)
  (stream-map stream-car
              (stream-filter (lambda (s) (not (stream-null? s))) 
                             stream)))
``` 

### b)

The behavior of the query system does not change.

`stream-flatmap` calls `flatten-stream`, and the most important thing is the interleaved merge. [exercise 4.72](./4.72.md) describes the problems that occur when merges are not interleaved.

If the incoming stream is empty, or is a single element of the stream, is not required to interleaved merge.

In the implementation of `simple-flatten`, if it is an empty stream, it will be filtered out by the `stream-filter`, and it will return the empty stream.If it is a single element stream, it will be filtered and then fetched by a `stream-car`.

In the case of empty or single-element streams, `flatten-stream` and `simple-flatten` are equivalent.
