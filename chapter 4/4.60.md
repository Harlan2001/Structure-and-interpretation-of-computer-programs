## exercise 4.60

### a)

The rule of `lives-near` is:

``` Scheme
(rule (lives-near ?person-1 ?person-2)
      (and (address ?person-1 (?town . ?rest-1))
           (address ?person-2 (?town . ?rest-2))
           (not (same ?person-1 ?person-2))))
```

The rule itself does not deal with the order of employees; person-1 and person-2 are symmetric.If (A and B) satisfy the rule, (B and A) must also satisfy the rule.So it happens twice for each pair of employees, just in a different order.

### b)

To occur only once per pair of employees, you can sort the employee's name in the query.

``` Scheme
(and (lives-near (?last-name-1 . ?n1) (?last-name-2 . ?n2))
     (lisp-value
       (lambda (s1 s2) (string<=? (symbol->string s1) (symbol->string s2))) 
       ?last-name-1 ?last-name-2))
```

Query result

``` Scheme
(and (lives-near (Aull DeWitt) (Reasoner Louis)) 
     (lisp-value 
       (lambda (s1 s2) (string<=? (symbol->string s1) (symbol->string s2))) 
       Aull 
       Reasoner))
(and (lives-near (Aull DeWitt) (Bitdiddle Ben)) (lisp-value ...))
(and (lives-near (Fect Cy D) (Hacker Alyssa P)) (lisp-value ...))
(and (lives-near (Bitdiddle Ben) (Reasoner Louis)) (lisp-value ...))                 
```
