## exercise 4.18

It can be found at P241 - [3.5.4](../chapter_3/delayed_stream.scm) based on the modified test.Rewrite the solve function.

``` Scheme
(define (solve f y0 dt)
  (define y (integral (delay dy) y0 dt))
  (define dy (stream-map f y))
  y)

(define (solve2 f y0 dt)
  (let ((y '*unassigned*)
        (dy '*unassigned*))
    (set! y (integral (delay dy) y0 dt))
    (set! dy (stream-map f y))
    y))

(define (solve3 f y0 dt)
  (let ((y '*unassigned*)
        (dy '*unassigned*))
    (let ((a (integral (delay dy) y0 dt))
          (b (stream-map f y)))
      (set! y a)
      (set! dy b))
    y))  
```

Where solve is the original function, solve2 is the transformation used for the text, and solve3 is the transformation used for this topic.

After testing, you know that solve2 works correctly.solve3 will fail and return an error message

``` 
car: contract violation
  expected: pair?
  given: '*unassigned
```

### Reason

solve3 error message that occurs in the inner let statement.  

``` Scheme
(let ((a (integral (delay dy) y0 dt))
      (b (stream-map f y))) ;; An error occurred in this statement
  xxx)   
```

`(stream-map f y)` despite the use of delay, the first element needs to be evaluated immediately, so the value `(car y)`is required.But y hasn't been assigned yet, so the value of y is still `*unassigned*`, so an error occurs.

solve2 works correctly.The following statements are executed in sequence

``` Scheme
(set! y (integral (delay dy) y0 dt))
(set! dy (stream-map f y))
```
When `(stream-map f y)` is called and the value `(car y)` is required, y is already correctly assigned.

Notice that the `(integral (delay dy) y0 dt)` statement in both solve2 and solve3 does not have an error.Because dy in the `(delay dy)` statement does not need to be evaluated immediately.
