## exercise 4.47

### a)

Louis' suggestion won't work. It could lead to an endless cycle.Like parsing statements

``` Scheme
(parse '(the cat eats))
```

The first time parse is successful. `try-again`  is a dead loop.Louis suggests the following code

``` Scheme
(define (parse-verb-phrase)
  (amb (parse-word verbs)
       (list 'verb-phrase
             (parse-verb-phrase)
             (parse-prepositional-phrase))))
```

The second option of `(parse-verb-phrase)` calls `(parse-verb-phrase)`recursively, with no stop condition.Once the first selection `(parse-word verbs)` fails and the verbs enter the second selection, the loop starts indefinitely.


### b)

Even if I switch the order of amb, it becomes

``` Scheme
(define (parse-verb-phrase)
  (amb (list 'verb-phrase
             (parse-verb-phrase)
             (parse-prepositional-phrase))
       (parse-word verbs)))
```       

The problem is still there.Parse statement at this time

``` Scheme
(parse '(the cat eats))
```

The first time parse, the loop is dead.
