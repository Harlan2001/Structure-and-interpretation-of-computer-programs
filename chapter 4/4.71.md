## exercise 4.71

The case of `simple-query` and `disjoin` is very similar, we use `simple-query` as an example.

The original `simple-query`would defer evaluation for all but the car part of the stream.But after modification

``` Scheme
(define (simple-query query-pattern frame-stream)
  (stream-flatmap
    (lambda (frame)
      (stream-append 
        (find-assertions query-pattern frame)
        (apply-rules query-pattern frame))) ;; apply-ruleswill be evaluated, which was deferred originally
    frame-stream))
```

The `apply-rules` are evaluated immediately.Sometimes the evaluation results of `apply-rules` are wasteful, and sometimes they create additional problems.

### a)

For example, the infinite loop rule of P322

``` Scheme
(assert! (married Minnie Mickey)) 
(assert! (rule (married ?x ?y) 
               (married ?y ?x)))
(married Mickey ?who)
```

In the original implementation, there would be an infinite loop.But because `apply-rules` are delayed,`simple-query`returns.At least it shows the result, even though the result is an infinite stream

``` Scheme
(married Mickey Minnie) 
(married Mickey Minnie) 
(married Mickey Minnie) 
....
``` 

The modified code, however, will continue to loop in `simple-query`.Nothing shows up.Printing an infinite stream is at least better than getting stuck and not responding.

Another example is the not statement query

``` Scheme
(assert! (married Minnie Mickey)) 
(assert! (rule (married ?x ?y) 
               (married ?y ?x)))
(not (married Mickey ?who))
```

`(married Mickey ?who)` returns an infinite stream, so not can be returned immediately (infinite streams also have a value), and the result is

``` Scheme
(not (married Mickey ?who))
```

But if the delay is removed, the above query will loop in `simple-query` deadly.

### b)

The reason for using `delay` in `disjoin` is similar to that for `simple-query`. If query

``` Scheme
(or P1 P2)
(not (or P1 P2))
```

Where P2 returns an infinite stream.

Without `delay`, P2 results have no delay evaluation, and the problem is similar to that of `simple-query`.
