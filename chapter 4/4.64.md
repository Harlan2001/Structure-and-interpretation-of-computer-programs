## exercise 4.64

### a)

Louis incorrectly changed the rule to

``` Scheme
(rule (outranked-by ?staff-person ?boss)
      (or (supervisor ?staff-person ?boss)
          (and (outranked-by ?middle-manager ?boss)
               (supervisor ?staff-person ?middle-manager))))
```

when query, 

``` Scheme
(outranked-by (Bitdiddle Ben) ?who)
```             
`?staff-person` constraint to `(Bitdiddle Ben)`。`?boss` constraint to到 `?who`. When run to a recursive rule

``` Scheme
(outranked-by ?middle-manager ?boss)
```

At this time `?boss` constraint to `?who`, `?middle-manager` has no constraint, so it queries again

``` Scheme
(outranked-by ?middle-manager ?who)
```

This leads to a recursive query, which repeats itself without stopping conditions.

### b)

Turns out the correct rule is

``` Scheme
(rule (outranked-by ?staff-person ?boss)
      (or (supervisor ?staff-person ?boss)
          (and (supervisor ?staff-person ?middle-manager)
               (outranked-by ?middle-manager ?boss))))
```

Compared to the wrong rule, but the order of the statements in and is different.Query at this time

``` Scheme
(outranked-by (Bitdiddle Ben) ?who)
```

The pattern matches first

``` Scheme
(supervisor (Bitdiddle Ben) ?middle-manager)
```

If the pattern match is unsuccessful, the recursive rule `outranked-by`is not queried at all.And if the match is successful, `?middle-manager` will have the constraint value. In this example  `?middle-manager` constraint is `(Warbucks Oliver)`。And then continue the query

``` Scheme
(outranked-by (Warbucks Oliver) ?who)
```

As you can see, you simply change the order of the statements in and in the rule.The query behavior of the program is also very different.
