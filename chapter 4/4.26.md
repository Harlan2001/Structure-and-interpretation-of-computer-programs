## exercise 4.26

### a)

unless can be implemented as a derivative of if. For example

``` Scheme
(unless (= b 0)
        (/ a b)
        (begin (display "exception: returning 0")
          0))

(define (factorial n)
  (unless (= n 1)
          (* n (factorial (- n 1)))
          1))         
```

Can be converted to
 
``` Scheme
(if (= b 0)
    (begin (display "exception: returning 0")
      0)
    (/ a b))

(define (factorial n)
  (if (= n 1)
      1
      (* n (factorial (- n 1)))))
```          

### b)

``` Scheme
(define select-y '(#t #f #t #t)) 
(define xs '(1 3 5 7)) 
(define ys '(2 4 6 8)) 
(define selected (map unless select-y xs ys))
```

In the above code, unless is used as a parameter to the map.

The above code works fine if unless is implemented as a procedure.But if you implement unless as a derived expression, your code won't work.
