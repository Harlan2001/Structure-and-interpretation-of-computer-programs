## exercise 4.25

The complete code in the question is

``` Scheme
(define (unless condition usual-value exceptional-value)
  (if condition exceptional-value usual-value))

(define (factorial n)
  (unless (= n 1)
          (* n (factorial (- n 1)))
          1))

(factorial 5)
```

### a)

In a normal application order Scheme, evaluating `(factorial 5)` causes an endless loop.

unless is a function, evaluating a function in application order requires that the value of an argument be computed in advance.So we need to compute `(factorial (- n 1)`. But when we compute `factorial` , we come across the unless function.So `factorial`needs to be calculated again.The process doesn't stop.


### b)

In a regular-ordered Scheme, the calculation  `(factorial 5)` correctly returns 120.Regular order evaluation can be verified in [lazyeval.scm](./lazyeval.scm).

In regular order, evaluation of the argument is delayed when evaluating unless.When n is equal to 1.The following code

``` Scheme
(* n (factorial (- n 1))
```

It's not really evaluated.unless simply returns 1 depending on the condition.So the  `factorial` function has a stop condition,
