## exercise 4.40

### a) 

Add conditions in turn, traversing all possibilities.The possibilities before and after each constraint are, respectively

``` Scheme
;; 3125
(require (distinct? (list baker cooper fletcher miller smith)))
;; 120
(require (not (= baker 5)))
;; 96
(require (not (= cooper 1)))
;; 78
(require (not (= fletcher 5)))
;; 60
(require (not (= fletcher 1)))
;; 42
(require (> miller cooper))
;; 15
(require (not (= (abs (- smith fletcher)) 1)))
;; 8
(require (not (= (abs (- fletcher cooper)) 1)))
;; 1
```

This means that without any constraints, there are 3125 possibilities, after adding  `distinct?` constrain, 120 possibilities remain.Add `(not (= baker 5))`, there are 96 possibilities.And so on.In the end, if all the constraints are met, there's only one possibility left.

### b)

A more efficient process is as follows.

``` Scheme
(define (multiple-dwelling)
  (let ((cooper (amb 2 3 4 5))
        (miller (amb 1 2 3 4 5)))
    (require (> miller cooper))
    (let ((fletcher (amb 2 3 4)))
      (require (not (= (abs (- fletcher cooper)) 1)))
      (let ((smith (amb 1 2 3 4 5)))
        (require (not (= (abs (- smith fletcher)) 1)))
        (let ((baker (amb 1 2 3 4)))
          (require (distinct? (list baker cooper fletcher miller smith)))
          (list (list 'baker baker)
                (list 'cooper cooper)
                (list 'fletcher fletcher)
                (list 'miller miller)
                (list 'smith smith)))))))
```
