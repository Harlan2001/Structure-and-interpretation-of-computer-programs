## exercise 4.10

We add a new assignment syntax based on the original syntax.For example

``` Scheme
(set! a 10)
``` 
It can also be written as

``` Scheme
(a := 10)
```

Modify the test based on [mceval.scm](./mceval.scm).

``` Scheme
(define (new-assignment? exp)
  (and (pair? exp) 
       (pair? (cdr exp)) 
       (eq? (cadr exp) ':=)))

(define (assignment? exp)
  (or (tagged-list? exp 'set!)
      (new-assignment? exp)))

(define (assignment-variable exp)
  (if (tagged-list? exp 'set!) 
      (cadr exp)
      (car exp)))

(define (assignment-value exp) (caddr exp))
```

Adding a new `:=` ssignment syntax does not require changing `eval` and `apply`ã€‚
