## exercise 4.14

### Recurrence problem

Let's first repeat the problem described in the question.In the case of just one list, the simplified map can be achieved as follows:

``` Scheme
(define (map op sequence)
  (if (null? sequence)
      '()
      (cons (op (car sequence)) (map op (cdr sequence)))))
```

Run [mceval.scm](./mceval.scm), enter the map implementation above, and then enter the simplest test code

``` Scheme
(map + (list 1 2 3))
```

It can run successfully.The custom map runs successfully, which is normal, but not successful.

----

Then add them to the `primitive-procedures` list in  [mceval.scm](./mceval.scm)

``` Scheme
(list 'map map)
```

Install the basic system process map.Enter the test code again

``` Scheme
(map + (list 1 2 3))
```

A runtime error occurs.

``` Scheme
application: not a procedure;
 expected a procedure that can be applied to arguments
  given: (primitive #<procedure:+>)
  arguments...:
```  

### Reason

When you install the base functions in your environment, the primitive tag is added.map and the value of the + symbol

``` Scheme
('primitive #<procedure:map>)   ; The value corresponding to the map symbol
('primitive #<procedure:+>)     ; The value corresponding to the + sign
```

`#<procedure:map>` This notation refers to the basic process map of the system.

`(map + (list 1 2 3))` will eventually call `apply-primitive-procedure`, proc and args corresponding to
 
``` Scheme
(primitive #<procedure:map>)
((primitive #<procedure:+>) (1 2 3))
```

So it ends up executing the basic process of the system

``` Scheme
(#<procedure:map> (`primitive #<procedure:+>) (1 2 3))
```
 
Note that the first parameter of the map, expected to be a procedure, is actually a list.So it's going to run wrong.

Similiarly, test code

``` Scheme
(map (lambda (x) (+ x 1)) (list 1 2))
```

It also causes the basic procedure map to execute incorrectly.

``` Scheme
application: not a procedure;
 expected a procedure that can be applied to arguments
  given: (procedure (x) ((+ x 1)) (((false true car cdr list cons null? display xxxx
  arguments...:
```

This is because the custom lambda, in the implementation of the evaluator, is represented as a list carrying the environment, and is not a primitive system procedure.
