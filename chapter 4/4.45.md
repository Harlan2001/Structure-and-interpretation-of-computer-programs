## exercise 4.45

``` Scheme
(parse '(the professor lectures to the student in the class with the cat))
```

I get 5 possible outcomes.There is no ambiguity in this

* The professor is lecturing to his students.

However, `(in the class)` and `(with the cat)` have different meanings depending on the sentence.

* `(in the class)` can modify student or lectures.(Two possibilities)
* `(with the cat)` can be professor, student, or class.(There are 3 possibilities)

The order of the original sentence is,

* lectures、student
* in the class、with the cat

Cross modifiers are forbidden in grammatical analysis, that is, lectures in the class and student with the cat do not occur, because in this case the prepositions cross.So the total probability is 2 * 3 - 1 = 5.
