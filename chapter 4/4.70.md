## exercise 4.70

The let constraint uses `old-assertions` to hold the current value of `THE-ASSERTIONS`construct a new stream, and insert assertion  first in the stream.The new flow thus constructed is limited.

If you do not have let constraint, the following statement

``` Scheme
(set! THE-ASSERTIONS
      (cons-stream assertion THE-ASSERTIONS))
```

`THE-ASSERTIONS` will reference itself, concatenating itself at the end of the stream.This recursive reference results in an infinite stream.

This is similar to the ones definition in P226
 
``` Scheme
(define ones (cons-stream 1 ones))
```

Suppose we change it a little bit

``` Scheme
(define ones '())
(set! ones (cons-stream 1 ones))
```

That's exactly how they wrote it.The text of the book reads

> This definition is like defining a recursive procedure: ones is an order pair, car is 1, and cdr is a promise to evaluate ones.The evaluation of its CDRS gives us a promise of 1 and the ones to evaluate, and so on.
