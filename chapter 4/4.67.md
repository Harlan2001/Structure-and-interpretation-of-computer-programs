## exercise 4.67

Modify the test based on [queryeval.scm](./queryeval.scm).

### Code

Start by adding some code to record the query history.Here `THE-QUERY-HISTORY`corresponds to THE global variable.In real engineering, it is not good to define global variables randomly.Global variables are defined here so that they change less.

``` Scheme
(define THE-QUERY-HISTORY '())

;;Clear history
(define (history-reset!)
  (set! THE-ASSERTIONS '()))

;;insert
(define (history-insert! query frame)
  (set! THE-ASSERTIONS 
        (cons (cons query frame) THE-ASSERTIONS)))

;;judgment
(define (history-has? query frame)
  (define (simple-instantiate query frame)
    (instantiate query
                 frame
                 (lambda (v f)
                   (string->symbol
                     (string-append "?" 
                                    (if (number? (cadr v))
                                        (string-append (symbol->string (caddr v)))
                                        (symbol->string (cadr v))))))
                 
                 ))
  (define (same? item query frame)
    (let ((i0 (simple-instantiate (car item) (cdr item)))
          (i1 (simple-instantiate query frame)))
      (equal? i0 i1)))
  (define (iter history query frame)
    (if (null? history)
        #f
        (if (same? (car history) query frame)
            #t
            (iter (cdr history) query frame))))
  (iter THE-ASSERTIONS query frame))
```

With the history code above.Slightly modify `query-driver-loop`, `simple-query`。

``` Scheme
(define (query-driver-loop)
  (prompt-for-input input-prompt)
  (let ((q (query-syntax-process (read))))
    (history-reset!)    ;;Clear history
    xxx))

(define (simple-query query-pattern frame-stream)
  (stream-flatmap
    (lambda (frame)
      (if (history-has? query-pattern frame)      ;;Check whether it has been queried
          the-empty-stream
          (begin 
            (history-insert! query-pattern frame) ;;Insert the query into the history
            (stream-append-delayed
              (find-assertions query-pattern frame)
              (delay (apply-rules query-pattern frame))))))
    frame-stream))
```    

### 一点注释

We insert `(cons query frame)` pairs in the history. .In `history-has?`, traverse the records to determine whether they are the same.

In the implementation of same?, `(cons query frame)`is restored to its original form for convenience of judgment.。

n particular, we write our lambda in `instantiate`  and do not call the `contract-question-mark`  function directly.Because the code  `apply-a-rule` renames the variable of the rule.For example, each time a rule is used, the variable  `(? boss)` renamed to

```
(? 1 boss)
(? 2 boss)
(? 3 boss)
```

If the `contract-question-mark` function is used, the names of these variables revert to `?boss-1`、`?boss-2`、`?boss-3`. This would cause the same rules to be applied over and over again, with different names, and still cause an infinite loop.In `simple-instantiate` , the above names are restored to `?boss`.

### Test

With the modification, the text used to cause an infinite loop of queries

``` Scheme
(assert! (married Minnie Mickey))
(assert! (rule (married ?x ?y)
               (married ?y ?x)))
(married Mickey ?who)
```

The query result can be correctly returned

``` Scheme
(married Mickey Minnie)
```
