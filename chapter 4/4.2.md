## P259 - [练习 4.2]

a)

Before modification, `application?` Judgment for last.The previous judgment is not true, will trigger the`application?` Judgment.If the 'application?'Up front, keywords such as define, if, and quote have their own meaning and can be mistaken for procedure calls.Such as statement

``` Scheme
(define x 3)
```

before modification `definition?` established first,execute `eval-definition`。But when you modify it, you try to find a procedure in the environment called `define` and assign x and 3 to it as arguments.But there is no procedure named 'define' in the environment, so it runs wrong.

b)

Tests can be modified based on  [mceval.scm](./mceval.scm). Modify as follows:

``` Scheme
(define (eval exp env)
  (cond ((self-evaluating? exp) exp)
        ((variable? exp) (lookup-variable-value exp env))
        ((quoted? exp) (text-of-quotation exp))
        ((application? exp)
         (apply (eval (operator exp) env)
                (list-of-values (operands exp) env)))
        ((assignment? exp) (eval-assignment exp env))
        ((definition? exp) (eval-definition exp env))
        ((if? exp) (eval-if exp env))
        ((lambda? exp)
         (make-procedure (lambda-parameters exp)
                         (lambda-body exp)
                         env))
        ((begin? exp) 
         (eval-sequence (begin-actions exp) env))
        ((cond? exp) (eval (cond->if exp) env))
        (else
          (error "Unknown expression type -- EVAL" exp))))
          
(define (application? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'call))
(define (operator exp) (cadr exp))
(define (operands exp) (cddr exp))
```
