## exercise 4.72

Suppose you merge S1 and S2, where S1 is an infinite stream.

If you simply concatenate S2 after S1, you need to iterate through the elements of S1 before the elements of S2 can appear.But S1 is an infinite stream, so the elements of S2 have no chance at all.

You need to stagger S1 and S2 so that both S1 and S2 have a chance to appear.
