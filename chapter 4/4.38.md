## exercise 4.38

And what they're saying is ignore the fact that Smith and Fletcher don't live in adjacent layers.That is, on the basis of [multiple_dwelling.scm](./multiple_dwelling.scm), delete

``` Scheme
(require (not (= (abs (- smith fletcher)) 1)))
```
this condition.

After removing the condition, the puzzle has the following 5 sets of solutions.

```
((baker 1) (cooper 2) (fletcher 4) (miller 3) (smith 5)) 
((baker 1) (cooper 2) (fletcher 4) (miller 5) (smith 3)) 
((baker 1) (cooper 4) (fletcher 2) (miller 5) (smith 3)) 
((baker 3) (cooper 2) (fletcher 4) (miller 5) (smith 1)) 
((baker 3) (cooper 4) (fletcher 2) (miller 5) (smith 1))
```
