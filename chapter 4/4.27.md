## exercise 4.27

The code responds to the lazy evaluator as follows

``` Scheme
(define count 0)
(define (id x)
  (set! count (+ count 1))
  x)

(define w (id (id 10)))

;;; L-Eval input:
count
;;; L-Eval value:
1
;;; L-Eval input:
w
;;; L-Eval value:
10
;;; L-Eval input:
count
;;; L-Eval value:
2
```

### a)

After defining w, count evaluates to 1, not 0.

Trace the evaluation of  `(define w (id (id 10)))`, in order

``` Scheme
(eval-definition exp env)
(define-variable! 'w (eval '(id (id 10)) env) env)
(eval '(id (id 10)) env)
(apply (actual-value 'id env) '((id 10)) env)
(apply id '((id 10)) env)
```

`(id 10)` is an argument to the id procedure, but the evaluation is delayed, and `(id 10)` itself is not executed yet.ã€‚

``` Scheme
(eval-sequence
  (procedure-body id)  ; Here is the side effect of calling set in the body of the id procedure!
  (extend-environment 
    (procedure-parameters id)
    (list-of-delayed-args '((id 10)) env)
    (procedure-environment id)
    )
  )
```

When evaluating  `eval-sequence` , the statement in the body of the id procedure is called

``` Scheme
(set! count (+ count 1))  ; The side effect, the count changes
x                         ; x is evaluated deferred, where x is (id 10).
```

So when w is defined, the id procedure is called only once.count is changed to 1.

In fact, under lazy evaluation, when we define w, no matter how many times the id process occurs, count is going to be 1.

``` Scheme
(define w (id (id (id (id 10)))))
count ; 1
```

### b)

When we evaluate w, we get 10, which is not unusual.

### c)

When evaluating w, force-it is fired, forcing the previous `(id 10)`expression to evaluate.So the id procedure is called again.So it's done again

``` Scheme
(set! count (+ count 1))
```

So the value of count is going to be 2.
