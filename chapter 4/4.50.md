## exercise 4.50

### a)

Modify the test based on [ambeval.scm](./ambeval.scm). `analyze` adds judgment

``` Scheme
((ramb? exp) (analyze-ramb exp))
```

The implementation of `analyze-ramb` is as follows

``` Scheme
(define (insert-list lst item n)
  (if (= n 0)
      (cons item lst)
      (cons (car lst) (insert-list (cdr lst) item (- n 1)))))

(define (shuffle lst)
  (if (null? lst)
      lst
      (let ((n (random (length lst))))
        (insert-list (shuffle (cdr lst)) (car lst) n))))

(define (ramb? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'ramb))
(define (ramb-choices exp) (shuffle (cdr exp)))

(define (analyze-ramb exp)
  (let ((cprocs (map analyze (ramb-choices exp))))
    (lambda (env succeed fail)
      (define (try-next choices)
        (if (null? choices)
            (fail)
            ((car choices) env
                           succeed
                           (lambda ()
                             (try-next (cdr choices))))))
      (try-next cprocs))))
```

### b)

In the code in Exercise 4.49, after amb is changed to ramb, the resulting sentences may be different each time the program is executed.But generating a dozen sentences in a row at a time would still be monotonous.Even changing to ramb does not help Alyssa in Exercise 4.49.

For example, if you run one run, the result is

``` Scheme
;; ;; (parse '(1 2 3))
(a class sleeps)
(a class eats)
(a class lectures)
(a class studies)
(a cat sleeps)
(a cat eats)
(a cat lectures)
(a cat studies)
(a professor sleeps)
(a professor eats)
(a professor lectures)
(a professor studies)
(a student sleeps)
(a student eats)
(a student lectures)
...

;; (parse '(1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9))
(a class with a class with a class sleeps)
(a class with a class with a class eats)
(a class with a class with a class lectures)
(a class with a class with a class studies)
(a class with a class with a cat sleeps)
(a class with a class with a cat eats)
(a class with a class with a cat lectures)
(a class with a class with a cat studies)
(a class with a class with a professor sleeps)
(a class with a class with a professor eats)
(a class with a class with a professor lectures)
(a class with a class with a professor studies)
(a class with a class with a student sleeps)
(a class with a class with a student eats)
(a class with a class with a student lectures)
...
```
