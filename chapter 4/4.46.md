## exercise 4.46

Our analyzer stores the input in `*unparsed*` and analyzes the sentence from left to right.During analysis, the value of `*unparsed*`  is modified.

So the analyzer is stateful, and the results of the previous analysis will affect the results of the subsequent analysis.Because of the state dependence, the parser relies heavily on the order of evaluation from left to right.For example

``` Scheme
(define (parse-sentence)
  (list 'sentence
        (parse-noun-phrase)
        (parse-verb-phrase)))
```

If the order of evaluation is from right to left, the sentences stored in `*unparsed*` are executed one by one.

``` Scheme
(parse-verb-phrase)
(parse-noun-phrase)
```

This leads to errors in the analysis.
