## exercise 4.65

In the query result of `(wheel ?who)` , Warbucks Oliver` appears several times.It's because he's a big boss with a lot of people.

To make it clear, we changed the wheel rule to

``` Scheme
(rule (wheel ?x ?middle-manager ?person)
      (and (supervisor ?middle-manager ?person)
           (supervisor ?x ?middle-manager)))
```

Query  `(wheel ?x ?middle-manager ?who)` and the result is 

``` Scheme
(wheel (Cratchet Robert) (Scrooge Eben) (Warbucks Oliver))
(wheel (Tweakit Lem E) (Bitdiddle Ben) (Warbucks Oliver))
(wheel (Reasoner Louis) (Hacker Alyssa P) (Bitdiddle Ben))
(wheel (Fect Cy D) (Bitdiddle Ben) (Warbucks Oliver))
(wheel (Hacker Alyssa P) (Bitdiddle Ben) (Warbucks Oliver))
```

In the query result, the relationship between the upper and lower levels at three layers is displayed.It can be seen that although Warbucks Oliver appears many times, the superior-subordinate relationship chain is different each time. .If ?x„ÄÅ?middle-manager are not displayed, the final big name will be queried, which will correspond to the query result in the question.

``` Scheme
(wheel (Warbucks Oliver))
(wheel (Warbucks Oliver))
(wheel (Bitdiddle Ben))
(wheel (Warbucks Oliver))
(wheel (Warbucks Oliver))
```

Note: I used DrRacket, and the order of the query results is a little different from the book.
