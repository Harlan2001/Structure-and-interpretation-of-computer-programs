## exercise 4.26

Modify  [mceval.scm](./mceval.scm) to add timing in`driver-loop`.

``` Scheme
(#%require (only racket current-inexact-milliseconds))

(define (driver-loop)
  (prompt-for-input input-prompt)
  (let* ((input (read))
         (star-time (current-inexact-milliseconds)))
    (let ((output (eval input the-global-environment)))
      (announce-output (- (current-inexact-milliseconds) star-time))
      (announce-output output-prompt)
      (user-print output)))
  (driver-loop))
```  

Write a piece of test code, add up the sum, and loop through it several times.So both functions, sum and loop, have recursion.

``` Scheme
(begin 
  (define (sum a b)
    (if (= a b)
        a
        (+ (sum a (- b 1)) b)))
  
  (define (loop n f)
    (cond ((> n 0) 
           (f)
           (loop (- n 1) f))))
  
  (loop 1000 (lambda () (sum 1 1000)))  
)
```

Run the above test code on the same machine as me.

* Original evaluator (no preanalysis), 12.372 seconds.
* The revised evaluator in this section (pre-analyzed, then evaluated) takes 5.738 seconds.

Test code loop multiple times.In analysis re-evaluation, no matter how many times the loop is executed, the analysis is only once.

So ignoring the error (the analysis is only once, and its time can be ignored), 5.738 seconds is pure execution time.However, in the original evaluator, each loop needs analysis and execution, so the analysis plus execution time is 12.372 seconds.

Therefore, in the above test code.For a single function (if not looping)

* The execution time ratio is `5.738/12.372 = 0.46 = 46%`ã€‚
*   `54%`of the analysis time.

Note that there are actually two sum and loop functions in the test code.The analysis and execution time ratios may be different, but should be discussed separately.The above calculation averages the two.But you can probably see that in this case, the analysis and execution time is roughly 50-50.
