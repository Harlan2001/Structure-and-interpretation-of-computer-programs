## exercise 4.15

This is the famous downtime problem.Use proof by contradiction.

Suppose `halt?`can be implemented correctly,  `(halt? try try)` will return true or false.

### Case 1

if  `(halt? try try)` returns true, which means `(try try)` will stop.But we expand the calculation process of `(try try)` is:

``` Scheme
(if (halt? try try)	; true
    (run-forever)
    'halted)
```

Obviously, after the judgment, will enter `(run-forever)`, `(try try)`  will not stop. `(halt? try try)` returns true contradiction.

### Case 2

if `(halt? try try)` returns false，which means `(try try)` will not stop.But we expand the calculation process of `(try try)` is:

``` Scheme
(if (halt? try try)	; false
    (run-forever)
    'halted)
```

Obviously, after judgment, it returns 'halted，and `(try try)`will stop.Contradict with  `(halt? try try)` returns false

### Conclusion

`(halt? try try)` Whether it returns true or false will create a contradiction.Therefore, the original assumption is not valid, and can not implement `halt?` function.The universal  `halt?` function does not exist.
