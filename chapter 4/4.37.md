## exercise 4.37

Ben is right.The method described in this question is more efficient than that in Exercise 4.35.

In Exercise 4.35, there are i, j and k nested searches, while the method in this question only has i and j nested searches.The search for k is directly replaced by the sqrt function.

When the search interval is large, calculating sqrt is much faster than being searched directly through.And the larger the interval, the more obvious the efficiency improvement of the method。

------

We can make a measurement.On my machine, I searched for 10 groups of elements and got the following results

| interval               | 1 到 100  | 1 到 200  | 1 到 400 |
|--------------------|----------|-----------|----------|
| Time-consuming of exercise 4.35 | 1.223 秒  | 6.611 秒  | 25.183 秒  |
| time-consuming of the method in this question| 0.042 秒 | 0.277 秒  | 0.364 秒  |

Time fluctuates with each measurement.But it can also be seen that the method in this case is more efficient.
