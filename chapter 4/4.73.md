## exercise 4.73

If I write it like the problem says, I need to call it right away

``` Scheme
(flatten-stream (stream-cdr stream))
```
`flatten-stream` is recursively called again.All the elements of `stream` need to be traversed immediately.The effect of flow delay evaluation is not achieved.

If `stream` is assumed to be an infinite stream, then `flatten-stream` will loop indefinitely.
