## exercise 4.68

Run [queryeval.scm](./queryeval.scm) to test the query.

### a)

``` Scheme
(assert! (rule (append-to-form () ?y ?y)))
(assert! (rule (append-to-form (?u . ?v) ?y (?u . ?z))
               (append-to-form ?v ?y ?z)))

(assert! (rule (reverse () ())))
(assert! (rule (reverse (?x . ?y) ?z)
               (and (reverse ?y ?u)
                    (append-to-form ?u (?x) ?z))))
```

The query `(reverse (1 2 3) ?x)`, the result is

``` Scheme
;; Query results:
(reverse (1 2 3) (3 2 1))
```

But when you query `(reverse ?x (1 2 3))`, you loop forever.

### b)

I'm going to reverse the order of judgment in and

``` Scheme
(assert! (rule (reverse () ())))
(assert! (rule (reverse (?x . ?y) ?z)
               (and (append-to-form ?u (?x) ?z)
                    (reverse ?y ?u))))
```

The query behavior is also reversed.Query  `(reverse (1 2 3) ?x)`, goes through an infinite loop.

Query `(reverse ?x (1 2 3))`, the result is

``` Scheme
;; Query results:
(reverse (3 2 1) (1 2 3))
```                   

### c)

However, you cannot implement a rule reverse that answers two-way queries

``` Scheme
(reverse (1 2 3) ?x)
(reverse ?x (1 2 3))
```
