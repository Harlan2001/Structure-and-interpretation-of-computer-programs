## exercise 4.39

### a) 

The order of the constraints does not affect the result.If I satisfy more than one condition at the same time, it's equivalent to the and operation.The and operation satisfies the commutative law and the associative rate.It's the same if you arbitrarily change the order of the conditions.
### b)

The order of constraints affects the speed of the program.
We should put the faster judgment up front.Slow judgment. Put it in the back.
For example, A is faster and B is slower.A comes first.In this way, when A fails, it will immediately quit and not really implement B's judgment.You can filter out as many time-consuming judgments as possible.
For the realization of `multiple-dwelling` .The slowest is `distinct?` judgment, we put it last, can speed up the process.

``` Scheme
(define (multiple-dwelling)
  (let ((baker (amb 1 2 3 4 5))
        (cooper (amb 1 2 3 4 5))
        (fletcher (amb 1 2 3 4 5))
        (miller (amb 1 2 3 4 5))
        (smith (amb 1 2 3 4 5)))
    (require (not (= baker 5)))
    (require (not (= cooper 1)))
    (require (not (= fletcher 5)))
    (require (not (= fletcher 1)))
    (require (> miller cooper))
    (require (not (= (abs (- smith fletcher)) 1)))
    (require (not (= (abs (- fletcher cooper)) 1)))
    (require (distinct? (list baker cooper fletcher miller smith))) ;;Put it to the end
    (list (list 'baker baker)
          (list 'cooper cooper)
          (list 'fletcher fletcher)
          (list 'miller miller)
          (list 'smith smith))))
```
