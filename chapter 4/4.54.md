## exercise 4.54

Modify the test based on [ambeval.scm](./ambeval.scm) and add a new branch to `analyze`.

``` Scheme
((require? exp) (analyze-require exp))
```

Its implementation is

``` Scheme
(define (require? exp) (tagged-list? exp 'require))
(define (require-predicate exp) (cadr exp))

(define (analyze-require exp)
  (let ((pproc (analyze (require-predicate exp))))
    (lambda (env succeed fail)
      (pproc env
             (lambda (pred-value fail2)
               (if (not (true? pred-value))
                   (fail2)
                   (succeed 'ok fail2)))
             fail))))
```
