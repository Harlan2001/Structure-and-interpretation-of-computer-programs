## Exercise 1.6

```Scheme
(define (new-if predicate then-caluse else-clause)
  (cond (predicate then-caluse)
        (else else-clause)))
```

predicate, then-caluse, and else-clause are arguments to new-if.

In the application order, all parameters need to be evaluated first.so
```Scheme
(define (sqrt-iter guess x)
  (new-if (good-enough? guess x)
          guess
          (sqrt-iter (improve guess x)
                     x)))
```
Whatever good-enough?Whatever the return value, the parameter (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x) must be evaluated first.This evaluation will trigger new-if again, and its argument sqrt-iter will need to be evaluated again.

So in sqrt-iter, there is no stop condition at all.The recursive process doesn't stop, so the stack overflows.

The special if is judged by the condition first, and the then-clause branch is evaluated when the condition is true, otherwise the other-clause branch is evaluated.There's only going to be one branch evaluation.It's not going to evaluate both branches at the same time like new-if.

Therefore, a custom new-if does not replace a special if.

However, in regular order, (sqrt-iter (improve guess x) x)) is not evaluated.sqrt-iter is going to unfold one layer at a time, and it's going to say good-enough, right?And evaluate the different branches.

In the regular order, new-if behaves just like the original if, and the program runs normally.
