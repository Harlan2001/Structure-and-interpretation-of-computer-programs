## exercise 1.23

Modify the program in Exercise 1.22, `prime?` function is written as:

``` Scheme
(define (smallest-divisor n)
  (find-divisor n 2))

(define (next-divisor n)
  (if (= n 2)
      3
      (+ n 2)))

(define (find-divisor n test-divisor)
  (cond ((> (square test-divisor) n) n)
        ((divides? test-divisor n) test-divisor)
        (else (find-divisor n (next-divisor test-divisor)))))

(define (divides? a b)
  (= (remainder b a) 0))

(define (prime? n)
  (= n (smallest-divisor n)))
```

Run the program and print out the results.

The program in Exercise 1.22 prints the following on the same machine.

```
1009 is prime: 0.001953125
1013 is prime: 0.0029296875

Take the average of the three prime time values.Make a table for comparison.

| n nearby            | 1000  | 10000  | 100000  | 1000000  | 10000000 | 100000000 |
|-------------------|-------|--------|---------|----------|----------|-----------|
| Practice 1.22 time(ms) | 0.002279 | 0.007731  | 0.022380  | 0.0703125   | 0.220052     | 0.686035 |
| Modified program time(ms)  | 0.002035 | 0.004313  | 0.013021  | 0.040609   |0.128337     | 0.409749    |
| Efficiency multiplier       | 1.119902   | 1.792488    | 1.718762  | 1.731451   |1.714642     | 1.674281    |

It can be seen that the speed increase is about 1.7, not 2.

Notice that near n = 1000, the multiple of 1.119902 appears particularly low.In addition, the prime time value of 1013 in "Exercise 1.22" is a little high, which is estimated to be the fluctuation of the computer operating environment.And the smaller the value of n, the faster the computer executes, the greater the impact of environmental fluctuations.

```
1009 is prime: 0.001953125
1013 is prime: 0.0029296875
1019 is prime: 0.001953125
```

--------

After modifying the algorithm, the speed is increased by 1.7, not 2.

The actual running time of the computer is affected by many factors, such as the computer's current CPU and memory usage, interpreter health, and time fluctuations.Modern computers are fast, and the faster the computer runs, the shorter the program itself runs, the greater the ripple effect.

Time fluctuations aside, not every line of code takes the same amount of time to compute when you modify `(+ test-divisor 1)` to `(next-divisor test-divisor)`.This actually becomes a function call, and the judgment is also included in the next-divisor.Therefore, the actual execution line time of `(next-divisor test-divisor)` will be longer than `(+ test-divisor 1)`.

We know that `search-for-primes` tests odd numbers in` (prime?n) `outside is guaranteed that the n passed in is not divisible by 2.Avoid the impact of the `next-divisor` function call itself if you temporarily modify your code to look like this.The measured time improvement will be closer to 2.

``` Scheme
(define (smallest-divisor n)
  (find-divisor n 2))

(define (find-divisor n test-divisor)
  (cond ((> (square test-divisor) n) n)
        ((divides? test-divisor n) test-divisor)
        (else (find-divisor n (+ 2 test-divisor))))) ; Direct plus 2

(define (divides? a b)
  (= (remainder b a) 0))

(define (prime? n)
  (= n (smallest-divisor n)))
```
