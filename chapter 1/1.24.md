## P36 - [练习 1.24]

Combine Exercise 1.22 and [Fermat detection](./fermat_test.md) and modify to

``` Scheme
#lang racket

Take the average of three prime time values and make a table

| n nearby       | 1000  | 10000  | 100000  | 1000000  | 10000000 | 100000000 |
|-------------|-------|--------|---------|----------|----------|-----------|
| time(ms)     | 0.134359 | 0.168620  | 0.195719  | 0.220052   |0.259115     | 0.296956     |
| The time difference in the front | -  |  0.034261 | 0.027100 | 0.024333 | 0.039062 | 0.037842 |

Because the complexity of the algorithm is o(loper), it is expected to increase by 10 times each time, and time only increases a constant. Note that the table is the difference value, not the ratio.

But you can see that this is not a strict constant value, it's going to be biased.

In this case, although the complexity of the algorithm is o(logne), the calculation of the calculation in the course of the program is the first order of the exponent, which affects the execution speed of the system expmod'.

The actual operating time of the computer is affected in many ways, such as the pre-cpu CPU and memory footprint, the interpretor running situation, and the time fluctuates. Modern computers perform fast, and the faster the computer runs, the shorter the program itself, the greater the volatility.

The algorithm complexity analysis, which can describe the speed of growth, has an estimate of the long-term growth of speed. But it's not the real absolute time.
