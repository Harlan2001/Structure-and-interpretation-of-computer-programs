## exercise 1.20

``` Scheme
(define (gcd a b)
  (if (= b 0)
      a
      (gcd b (remainder a b))))
```

The whole calculation process using regular order `(gcd 206 40)` is a bit verbose to analyze.

``` Scheme
(gcd 206 40)
(if (= 40 0)    ;; #f
    206
    (gcd 40 (remainder 206 40)))
(gcd 40 (remainder 206 40))
```
For the sake of description

* Set `B0 = (remainder 206 40) = 6`，containing one remainder call.

Note that B0 does not represent the number 6, but the `(remainder 206 40)`. The regular order does not compute at first, only substitution expansion.

``` Scheme
(gcd 40 B0)
(if (= B0 0)    ;; #f, Call remainder once
	40
	(gcd B0 (remainder 40 B0)))
```

* Call remainder once
* Set `B1 = (remainder 40 B0) = 4`, containing two remainder calls.

``` Scheme
(gcd B0 B1)
(if (= B1 0)    ;; #f, Call remainder twice
    B0
    (gcd B1 (remainder B0 B1)))
```
    
* remainder is called 3 times in aggregate.
* Set `B2 = (remainder B0 B1) = 2`, containing four remainder calls.

``` Scheme
(gcd B1 B2)
(if (= B2 0)    ;; #f, Call remainder four times
    B1
    (gcd B2 (remainder B1 B2)))
```
    
* remainder is called seven times.
* Set `B3 = (remainder B1 B2) = 0`, containing seven remainder calls.。

``` Scheme
(gcd B2 B3)
(if (= B3 0)    ;; #t，remainder is called seven times
    B2
    (gcd B3 (remainder B2 B3)))
B2              ;; Call remainder four times
```

Thus, the remainder ends up cumulative calling `7 + 7 + 4 = 18`  times。You can see that the regular order is completely replaced first and evaluated last.remainder is computed multiple times. For example, B2 is just shorthand and, expanding fully, computes `(remainder 206 40)` twice。

``` Scheme
B2
(remainder B0 B1)
(remainder B0 (remainder 40 B0))
(remainder (remainder 206 40) (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))
``` 

-----

Using the application order expansion `(gcd 206 40)` is much simpler, as follows

``` Scheme
(gcd 206 40)
(gcd 40 (remainder 206 40)) ;; Accumulated 1 times
(gcd 40 6)
(gcd 6 (remainder 40 6))    ;; Accumulated 2 times
(gcd 6 4)
(gcd 4 (remainder 6 4))     ;; Accumulated 3 times
(gcd 4 2)
(gcd 2 (remainder 4 2))     ;; Accumulated 4 times
(gcd 2 0)
2
``` 

As you can see, remainder is called four times for application-ordered evaluation.Much less than using regular order.
