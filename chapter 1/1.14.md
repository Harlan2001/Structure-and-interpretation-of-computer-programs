------
The image above is not drawn by hand, but instead of using the lua program to generate the graphviz drawing language, and using graphviz to generate SVG images。see [Lua Program source code](exercise_1_14_dot.lua)。By modifying the other values on the line `count_change(11)` , you can generate a calculation of the other values.
