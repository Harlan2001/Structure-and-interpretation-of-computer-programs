```Scheme
(define (expmod base exp m)
  (remainder (fast-expt base exp) m)) 
```

expmod written this way is correct in theory, but it has problems in practice.fast-expt factorials cause larger and larger numbers.

Computers represent numbers with precision, such as 64-bit integer values.When the accuracy of the computer is out of range, one situation is data overflow, the calculation is not accurate.Another case is to use a program to simulate the operation of large integers.Within the range of computer accuracy, multiplying two numbers takes little difference in calculation time.But when it goes beyond the accuracy range, it needs to use a program to simulate, and the larger the number, the slower the calculation will be.

So the above expmod implementation, the number is getting larger and larger.One possible outcome is that the data is overflowing and the calculation is inaccurate.Another possible outcome is that the calculations get slower and slower.


And the original expmod implementation
```Scheme
(define (expmod base exp m)
  (cond ((= exp 0) 1)
        ((even? exp)
         (remainder 
           (square (expmod base (/ exp 2) m))
           m))
        (else
          (remainder 
            (* base (expmod base (- exp 1) m))
            m))))
```

(expmod base exp m) use the remainder of the remainder to calculate the results will not exceed m3. The implementation process is recursive, and the following operation is performed.

```Scheme
(square (expmod base (/ exp 2) m))
(* base (expmod base (- exp 1) m)
```  
   
In the whole calculation process, the maximum number that can occur is not more than m * m and base * m.As long as you control the initial input values, the results will not overflow and will be much faster.
