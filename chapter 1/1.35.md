## exercise 1.35

The value of the golden ratio φ is

$$\phi=\frac{1+\sqrt{5}}{2}$$

Satisfy the equation:

$$\phi^{2}=\phi+1$$

After the transformation, is 

$$\phi=1+\frac{1}{\phi}$$

According to the definition of fixed point, φ is the fixed point of the equation  `f(x) = 1 + 1/x`.

``` Scheme
#lang racket

(define (fixed-point f first-guess)
  (define (close-enough? v1 v2)
    (let ((tolerance 0.00001))
      (< (abs (- v1 v2)) tolerance)))
  (define (try guess)
    (let ((next (f guess)))
      (if (close-enough? guess next)
          next
          (try next))))
  (try first-guess))
