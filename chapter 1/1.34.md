```Scheme
(define (f g)
  (g 2))
```

When executing the expression (f f) in DrRacket, an error occurs:

```
"application: not a procedure;
 expected a procedure that can be applied to arguments
  given: 2
  arguments...:"
```
  
 
When executing (f f) in Mit-Scheme, the same error occurs, but the error description is different.

```
 "The object 2 is not applicable."
```
  
 Expand the calculation process of (f f) to be
```
 (f f)
(f 2)
(2 2)	; Error, The object 2 is not applicable.
```
