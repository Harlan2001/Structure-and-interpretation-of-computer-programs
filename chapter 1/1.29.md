### Definite integral

So the definite integral is the same thing as the area of f of x with respect to the X-axis.

The basic idea for the definite integral of f(x) is to divide [a, b] into a very small region of n parts.The length of each region is `h = (b - a) / n` and the x-coordinate of each region is x0, x1, x2, x3...xn.So I can figure out the function points above f(x).

```
(x0, y0) = (x0, f(x0))
(x1, y1) = (x1, f(x1))
(x2, y2) = (x2, f(x2))
(x3, y3) = (x3, f(x3))
(x4, y4) = (x4, f(x4))
.....
```

Next, each region is chosen to interpolate these function points using a much simpler function P(x) than f(x).The smaller the region, the closer P(x) looks to f(x).The area of P of x, the closer it is to the area of f of x.

P(x) is much simpler than f(x), so it's easier to deal with.For example, for each region, the simplest P(x) function is a horizontal line

```
P(x0) = y0
P(x1) = y1
P(x2) = y2
P(x3) = y3
....
```

So the area of P of x is equal to

```
A = P(x0) * h + P(x1) * h + P(x2) * h ... 
  = h * (y0 + y1 + y2 + ....)
  = h * [f(x0) + f(x1) + f(x2) + .... ]
```

This formula is the integral function on page P39.Using a horizontal line to approximate f(x) is equivalent to treating each small region as a rectangle. The above formula can also be called <b> rectangular method formula </b>.

So P of x could have chosen some other function, for example,  $P(x) = qx + r$，where each region approximates f of x by a straight line.Then it is equivalent to treat each small region as a trapezoid, and the corresponding formula obtained can be called<b>trapezoid method formula</b>。

### Simpson formula derivation

The p(x) can also choose a straight line, but choose a second curve that is a px-+ + r0. The quadratic curve is closer to f(x), which is also divided into n regions, and the accuracy of the calculation is higher. In the same way, you can use three curves, four curves, and so on, but the higher number of curves, which can be very troublesome, and the accuracy of the improvement is not obvious, and it's a little bit worthless.

A conic is a good balance of computation and precision.The quadratic curve is used to approximate f(x), and the formula obtained is the<b>Simpson formula</b>described in the title. Since a conic is a parabola, this formula can also be called the <b>parabola method of the definite integral</b>. So let's derive that.

<img width="320" src="./simpsons_method.svg"/>

You need three points to find a conic, so you have to cross two intervals.Each interval has length `h = (b - a) / n`. The blue f(x) is the original function, and the red P(x) is the interpolated conic.So let's figure out the area of P of x with respect to the horizontal axis, so the area of P(x) is roughly equal to the area of f(x).


To facilitate the calculation of area A, we take the x-coordinate of point m `x = 0` and then the corresponding point a `x = -h`. There are 3 points on f(x)

$$(-h, y_{a})、(0, y_{m})、(h, y_{b})$$

These three point coordinates go into the quadratic equation $y=P(x)=px^{2}+qx+r$，we have

$$\begin{aligned}&y_{a}=ph^{2}-qh+r\\ &y_{m}=r \\ &y_{b}=ph^{2}+qh+r\end{aligned}$$

so $y_{a}-2y_{m}+y_{b}=2ph^{2}$

Desired area

$$\begin{aligned}A &= \int_{-h}^{h}(px^{2}+qx+r)dx\\ &= \left [\frac{1}{3}px^{3}+\frac{q}{2}x^{2}+rx  \right ]_{-h}^{h} = \frac{2}{3}ph^{3}+2rh \\ &=\frac{1}{3}h(2ph^{2}+6r)=\frac{1}{3}h(y_{a}-2y_{m}+y_{b}+6y_{m}) \\ &=\frac{1}{3}h(y_{a}+4y_{m}+y_{b}) \end{aligned}$$
 
That's the formula for the area of the two regions.So the area of the three-point parabola through `(x0, y0)、(x1, y1)、(x2, y2)` is

$$A_{0}=\frac{1}{3}h(y_{0}+4y_{1}+y_{2})$$

The area of the three-point parabola of `(x2, y2)、(x3, y3)、(x4, y4)` is

$$A_{1}=\frac{1}{3}h(y_{2}+4y_{3}+y_{4})$$

$$A_{2}=\frac{1}{3}h(y_{4}+4y_{5}+y_{6})$$

.....

and so on

And if you add up all the area, you get the final formula.

$$A=\frac{1}{3}h[(y_{0}+y_{n})+2(y_{2}+y_{4}+...+y_{n-2})+4(y_{1}+y_{3}+...+y_{n-1})]$$

The two points at the head and the tail, the multiple factor is 1;When decimal, the multiple factor is 4;Even points have a factor of 2.
