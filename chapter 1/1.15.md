```Scheme
#lang sicp

(define (cube x) (* x x x))

(define (p x)
  (display "call p, arg = ")
  (display x)
  (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))

(define (sine angle)
  (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
      angle
      (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))

(sine 12.15)
```

and the return is:

```
call p, arg = 0.049999999999999996
call p, arg = 0.1495
call p, arg = 0.4351345505
call p, arg = 0.9758465331678772
call p, arg = -0.7895631144708228
-0.39980345741334
```

a) so p is called by 5 times

b) When evaluating sine(a), a is divided by 3.0 each time.sine is a recursive procedure, a / 3.0 per recurrence.

The complexity of the space and time of the sine is O(logA), and the logarithm increases.

Every time a is increased by three times, the number of calls to p is increased by one.

```
(sine 1),     p is called 3 times。
(sine 3),     p is called 4 times。
(sine 9),     p is called 5 times。
(sine 27),    p is called 6 times。
(sine 81),    p is called 7 times。
(sine 243),   p is called 8 times。
(sine 729),   p is called 9 times。
(sine 2187),  p is called 10 times。
(sine 6561),  p is called 11 times。
(sine 19683), p is called 12 times。
