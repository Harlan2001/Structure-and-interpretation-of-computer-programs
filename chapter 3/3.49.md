## exercise 3.49

### example 1

Imagine a computer with two devices, a printer and a plotter.Two processes process the document separately, and the process doesn't know what resources it needs until it does.So a process acquires the printer and then realizes that it needs a plotter.The other process acquires the plotter first, then realizes that it needs a printer.Each process acquires a device and waits for the other process to run out of the other device, resulting in a deadlock.Devices are allocated not initially, but gradually over the course of the process, so it is useless to number them separately.

For the above problem of gradual allocation of devices, a classic solution is to obtain the devices with a high number before obtaining the devices with a low number.For example, if the printer number is 1 and the plotter number is 2, the process P1 needs the plotter because the plotter number is higher, so the printer is also assigned to P1.However, this allocation method can prevent device deadlock but reduce processing efficiency.

### example 2

Suppose peter and mary are a couple with their own accounts, Peter-acc and Mary-acc.In addition, both accounts set each other's accounts as associated accounts, that is, when the balance of peter-acc is insufficient to pay, it will withdraw the balance of mary-acc.And when the balance of mary-acc is not enough to pay, it goes back to draw the balance of peter-acc.

Now, consider the situation where peter and mary spend at different places, and the balance of their respective accounts is not enough to pay the order, so Pet-acc tries to access the associated account Mary-acc, and Mary-acc also visits Pet-ACC at the same time.Because both accounts have already been opened, and both are trying to access the associated account, this creates a deadlock: the payment will never be made unless one of peter's or mary's actively exits the account.
