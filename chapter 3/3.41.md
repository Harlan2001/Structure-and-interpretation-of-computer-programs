## exercise 3.41

``` Scheme
((eq? m 'balance) balance)
```

There is no need to add additional protection.

The code here only reads balance and does not set blance, which has no side effect on other processes.Even if process A is interrupted and the process of reading balance is inserted in the middle, process A has no impact.

balance is read only once, and the operation cannot be divided, so it does not need any protection.

The operation of reading balance cannot be separated by itself.And even if other processes are interrupted, other processes will not be affected.Therefore, the read operation here does not require additional protection.
