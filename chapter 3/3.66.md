## P237 - [练习 3.66]

Print the `(pairs integers integers)` terms first, and look for a pattern.Add the serial number and print 30 items.

```
1: (1 1)
2: (1 2)
3: (2 2)
4: (1 3)
5: (2 3)
6: (1 4)
7: (3 3)
8: (1 5)
9: (2 4)
10: (1 6)
11: (3 4)
12: (1 7)
13: (2 5)
14: (1 8)
15: (4 4)
16: (1 9)
17: (2 6)
18: (1 10)
19: (3 5)
20: (1 11)
21: (2 7)
22: (1 12)
23: (4 5)
24: (1 13)
25: (2 8)
26: (1 14)
27: (3 6)
28: (1 15)
29: (2 9)
30: (1 16)
```

For ease of description, we use the num notation to represent the sequence number of an order pair.For example

```
num(1 1) = 1
num(1 2) = 2
num(2 2) = 3
```

### a)

Notice that there is a rule in the order of `(1 n)`.

```
(1 1), (1 2), xx, (1 3), xx, (1 4), xx, (1 5), xx, (1 6)
```

Where xx is an unknown item, analysis shows that there is a difference of 1 between (1 1) and (1 2).And then the sequence number is off by 2.According to this rule.There are

```
num(1 1) = 1                        ; n = 1
num(1 2) = num(1 1) + 1 = 2         ; n = 2
num(1 n) = num(1 2) + (n - 2) * 2   ; n > 2
```

So we know that the sequence number of 1, 100 is 1

```
num(1 100) = 2 + 98 * 2 = 198
```

### b)

In addition to the terms `(1 n)` , let's analyze some of the terms `(n n)`, which are located on the diagonal and are also special.When you don't have a clue, you can start with the special, then the general.

```
1: (1 1)
3: (2 2)
7: (3 3)
15: (4 4)
```
Notice that these terms are also very regular, and the sequence number is.

```
num(n n) = 2^n - 1
```

To verify this rule, we print more items, such as:

```
1: (1 1)
3: (2 2)
7: (3 3)
15: (4 4)
31: (5 5)
63: (6 6)
127: (7 7)
```
There are patterns.So we know that the sequence number of (100, 100) is

```
num(100 100) = 2 ^ 100 - 1
```

### c)

In order to know the order number of a more general order pair, let's first look at the order number of (2 n).

```
3: (2 2)
5: (2 3)
9: (2 4)
13: (2 5)
17: (2 6)
21: (2 7)
25: (2 8)
29: (2 9)
33: (2 10)
```

Notice that there's a difference of 2 between (2 2) and (2 3), and then there's a difference of 4.So we have

```
num(2 2) = 2 ^ 2 - 1 = 3            ; n = 2
num(2 3) = num(2 2) + 2 = 5         ; n = 3
num(2 n) = num(2 3) + (n - 3) * 4   ; n > 3
```

And let's look at the order of (3 n) .

```
7: (3 3)
11: (3 4)
19: (3 5)
27: (3 6)
35: (3 7)
43: (3 8)
51: (3 9)
```

Notice that there is a difference of 4 between (3, 3) and (3, 4), and then there is a difference of 8.So there is

```
num(3 3) = 2 ^ 3 - 1                ; n = 3
num(3 4) = num(3 3) + 4             ; n = 4
num(3 n) = num(3 4) + (n - 4) * 8   ; n > 4
```

If we look at the order of (4 n) , there is

```
15: (4 4)
23: (4 5)
39: (4 6)
55: (4 7)
71: (4 8)
```

so

```
num(4 4) = 2 ^ 4 - 1                 ; n = 4
num(4 5) = num(4 4) + 8              ; n = 5
num(4 n) = num(4 5) + (n - 5) * 16   ; n > 5
```

I'm going to put all the patterns that I've observed before together.There are

```
num(1 1) = 1                        ; n = 1
num(1 2) = num(1 1) + 1 = 2         ; n = 2
num(1 n) = num(1 2) + (n - 2) * 2   ; n > 2

num(2 2) = 2 ^ 2 - 1 = 3            ; n = 2
num(2 3) = num(2 2) + 2 = 5         ; n = 3
num(2 n) = num(2 3) + (n - 3) * 4   ; n > 3

num(3 3) = 2 ^ 3 - 1                ; n = 3
num(3 4) = num(3 3) + 4             ; n = 4
num(3 n) = num(3 4) + (n - 4) * 8   ; n > 4

num(4 4) = 2 ^ 4 - 1                 ; n = 4
num(4 5) = num(4 4) + 8              ; n = 5
num(4 n) = num(4 5) + (n - 5) * 16   ; n > 5
```

We can guess `num(m n)， where n >= m` the formula is

```
num(m, m) = 2 ^ m - 1                               ; n = m
num(m, m + 1) = num(m, m) + 2 ^ (m - 1)             ; n = m + 1
num(m, n) = num(m, m + 1) + [n - (m + 1)] * 2 ^ m   ; n > m + 1
```

### verification

Let's verify that

```
175: (5 10)
```
This term

```
num(5 5) = 2 ^ 5 - 1 = 31
num(5 6) = 31 + 2^(5-1) = 47
num(5 10) = 47 + (10 - 6) * (2^5) = 175
```

The formula is verified.

Let's verify this

```
639: (8 10)
```

```
num(8 8) = 2^8 - 1 = 255
num(8 9) = 255 + 2^(8-1) = 383
num(8 10) = 383 + (10 - 9) * (2^8) = 639
```
