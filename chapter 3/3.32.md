## exercise 3.32

And gate code is

``` Scheme
(define (and-gate a1 a2 output)
  (define (and-action-procedure)
    (let ((new-value (logical-and (get-signal a1) (get-signal a2))))
      (after-delay and-gate-delay
                   (lambda ()
                     (set-signal! output new-value)))))
  (add-action! a1 and-action-procedure)
  (add-action! a2 and-action-procedure)
  'ok)
```

Suppose at the beginning

```
a1 = 0
a2 = 1
```

Change it to '(a1, a2) = (1, 0)'.There can be two sequences, one of which is

``` Scheme
(set-signal! a1 1)
(set-signal! a2 0)
```

or

``` Scheme
(set-signal! a2 0)
(set-signal! a1 1)
```

### Analysis sequence 1

Let's look at the former sequence first.

When calling '(set-signal!a1 1) ', a1 = 1.But it's important to note that a2 hasn't changed yet, it's still 1.so

```
a1 = 1
a2 = 1
```
The result of logical-and is 1.

Then call '(set-signal!a2 0) ', then a1 = 1, a2 = 0, so 'logical-and' is 0.Hence the timing

``` Scheme
(set-signal! a1 1)
(set-signal! a2 0)
```

Two processes are triggered and added to the pending table, in order

``` Scheme
(set-signal! output 1)
(set-signal! output 0)
```

And their time slots are the same.Processes in the table are then processed.

* If processing is done in the original order (first in, first out), the final output is 0.
* If the last in, first out processing, the final output result is 1.

Obviously, a1 is equal to 1 and a2 is equal to 0 in our final state.The correct output with an and-gate results in 0.So if you do LIFO, you get the wrong result.

### Analysis sequence 2

Similarly, let's do sequence 2.We start with a1 = 0, a2 = 1.The following sequence

``` Scheme
(set-signal! a2 0)
(set-signal! a1 1)
```

So let's set a2 = 0, and notice that a1 has not changed yet, a1 = 0.So logical-and is equal to 0.
And then a1 = 1, so a2 = 0.So logical-and is equal to 0.Two statements are then fired and added to the pending list
``` Scheme
(set-signal! output 0)
(set-signal! output 0)
```

Their time slots are the same.Obviously, the result is the same for and-gate regardless of FIFO or LIFO.

But don't assume that setting a2 first and then a1 is always right.This timing, for or-gate, is wrong.

* a2 = 0，a1 = 0, `logical-or` result is 0
* a1 = 1，a2 = 0, `logical-or` result is 1

For or-gate, that kind of timing, it fires the statement

``` Scheme
(set-signal! output 0)
(set-signal! output 1)
```
So, for or-gate, the last in, first out process is still wrong.

### Conclusion

In digital circuit analog, the process of adding to the to-do list.If the time period is the same, it must be handled in strict order (first in, first out), otherwise the final state will depend on the setting sequence, which is likely to be wrong.
