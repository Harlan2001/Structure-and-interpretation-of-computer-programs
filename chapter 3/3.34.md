## exercise 3.34

The test code is as follows

``` Scheme
#lang racket

(#%require "constraints.scm")

(define (squarer a b)
  (multiplier a a b))

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
(define a (make-connector))
(define b (make-connector))

(probe "a" a)
(probe "b" b)

(squarer a b)

(set-value! a 20 'user)
(forget-value! a 'user)

(set-value! b 400 'user)
```

Its output is

```
Probe: b = 400
Probe: a = 20
'done
Probe: b = ?
Probe: a = ?
'done
Probe: b = 400
```

So Louis squared this way, and when you set a, you can derive b.But on the flip side, when you set b, you can't derive a.

### Reason

See the definition of 'multiplier' for the reason

``` Scheme
(define (multiplier m1 m2 product)
  (define (process-new-value)
    (cond ((or (and (has-value? m1) (= (get-value m1) 0))
               (and (has-value? m2) (= (get-value m2) 0)))
           (set-value! product 0 me))
          ((and (has-value? m1) (has-value? m2))
           (set-value! product
                       (* (get-value m1) (get-value m2))
                       me))
          ((and (has-value? product) (has-value? m1))
           (set-value! m2
                       (/ (get-value product) (get-value m1))
                       me))
          ((and (has-value? product) (has-value? m2))
           (set-value! m1
                       (/ (get-value product) (get-value m2))
                       me))))
  xxx)
```

Louis' squarer 'definition.The parameters of m1 and m2 are the same and both are a.

Therefore, when a is set, both m1 and m2 have values, and product(that is, b value) can be derived.

But when b is set, product has a value.m1 and m2 have no value yet,

```
(has-value? product) = true
(has-value? m1) = false
(has-value? m2) = false
```

None of the conditions in 'cond' are satisfied.So you can't derive the value of m1, the value of m2, or the value of a.Although the m1 and m2 are the same, the multiplier is unknown.
