## exercise 3.53

``` Scheme
(define s (cons-stream 1 (add-streams s s)))
```

You can view s as s moving one position, adding to itself.The first number is 1, the second number is 1 + 1 = 2, and the third number is 2 + 2 = 4.....

```
    1   2   4   8   16  32  64  ... = s 
+   1   2   4   8   16  32  64  ... = s
-------------------------------------------
1   2   4   8   16  32  64  128 ... = s
```

s is a power of two: 1, 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, 64, 128...

Run the program can verify the results.
