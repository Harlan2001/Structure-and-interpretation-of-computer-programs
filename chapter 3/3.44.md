## exercise 3.44

Louis is not rightã€‚

``` Scheme
(define (transfer from-account to-account amount)
  ((from-account 'withdraw) amount)
  ((to-account 'deposit) amount))
```

The transfer function above assumes that the balance of 'from-account' and 'to-account' are individually protected by serialization.I can break it down into two parts
```
1. ((from-account 'withdraw) amount)
2. ((to-account 'deposit) amount)
```

1 and 2 parts can be regarded as an indissoluble whole.As long as both parts 1 and 2 are completed, the total balance before and after transfer can be guaranteed to remain unchanged regardless of any other operations inserted in the middle.

The total balance remains the same, which is the invariant of the transfer operation.This is similar to the analysis in [Exercise 3.43](./exercise_3_43.md) c).

As long as the account is protected by serial separately and both 1 and 2 can be completed, the transfer implementation is correct.

The difference between transfer and exchange is that exchange needs to read the balance of the two accounts, calculate the difference, and then invoke the withdraw and deposit of the two accounts.Therefore, in the implementation of exchange, each account has the process of reading and modifying.If the exchange is interrupted, another process modifies the account balance.The difference that exchange calculated earlier was wrong.

However, transfer does not use additional read balance, and its read operations implicit in withdraw and deposit are also protected by serialization.So proper implementation of exchange requires more sophisticated protection than transfer does.
