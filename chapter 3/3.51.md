## exercise 3.51

### a)

In the DrRacket

``` Scheme
(define x (stream-map show (stream-enumerate-interval 0 10)))
```

It's going to print 0.In stream-map, show is called once to get the value of '(car x)' and the rest of the evaluation is deferred.

### b)

``` Scheme
(stream-ref x 5)
```

Will output

```
1
2
3
4
5
5
```

The preceding 1-5 is the print value of display-line in the `show` unction.The last 5 is the return value of `(stream-ref x 5)` 

As you can see from the print, the stream-map implementation uses delay delay evaluation.show is not called directly when stream-map is called.The show function is actually fired when stream-ref is used.And when you get to 5, you get what you want, you stop.I didn't go ahead and print 6-10.

### c)

``` Scheme
(stream-ref x 7)
```

Will output

```
6
7
7
```

The preceding 6-7 is the print value of `display-line` in the  `show`function.The last 7 is the return value of `(stream-ref x 7)` .

The delay function used by `cons-stream`has a memorizing procedure.As stated in P225, the mnemonic procedure saves the results of the computation the first time the procedure is run.When evaluated again at a later time, you can simply return the existing result.

`(stream-ref x 5)` was called before, 0-5 has called show to get the result.So `(stream-ref x 7)` can return the existing result for 0-5 without calling show again.So it's not going to print out 0 minus 5 again.I'm just going to print out 6 minus 7 that I haven't evaluated before.


### Complete test code

```Scheme
#lang racket

(require "stream.scm")

(define (stream-map proc . argstreams)
  (if (stream-null? (car argstreams))
      the-empty-stream
      (cons-stream 
        (apply proc (map stream-car argstreams))
        (apply stream-map
               (cons proc (map stream-cdr argstreams))))))

;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;;
(define (show x)
  (display-line x)
  x)

(define x (stream-map show (stream-enumerate-interval 0 10)))
(stream-ref x 5)
(stream-ref x 7)
```
