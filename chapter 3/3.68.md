## exercise 3.68

Louis' revision is problematic.

``` Scheme
(define (pairs s t)
  (interleave
    (stream-map (lambda (x) (list (stream-car s) x))
                t)
    (pairs (stream-cdr s) (stream-cdr t))))
```    

Evaluate`(pairs integers integers)`with Louis defined pairs. The program will loop endlessly.

Because Lousi defines `pairs` that call `interleave`. When `interleave` is called, each parameter needs to be evaluated first.So we need to ask for the value `(pairs (stream-cdr s) (stream-cdr t))`.

So call `interleave` again,  call `pairs` again, call `interleave` ... . `integers` were infinite streams, and the recursive calls would not stop, so programs looped indefinitely.

While in the original `pairs`definition,  `cons-stream`is used, and the following `interleave` will delay evaluation.When enough items are fetched, the call stops naturally.
