## exercise 3.42

In the back of the book, the chapter, the first, the make-serializer'

``` Scheme
(define (make-serializer)
  (let ((mutex (make-mutex)))
    (lambda (p)
      (define (serialized-p . args)
        (mutex 'acquire)
        (let ((val (apply p args)))
          (mutex 'release)
          val))
      serialized-p)))
```

You can determine that the modified make-account implementation is still secure.Either a new procedure is returned each time before the modification, or the same serialization procedure is returned after the modification.The same mutex can be used between procedures as long as the same 'serializer' is used.mutex ensures that the timing is mutually exclusive and not interrupted randomly.
 
For example, P1 is executing '(protected-withdraw 10)' to get mutex.It is then interrupted and switched to P2 executing '(protected-withdraw 20)', at which point P2 will attempt to obtain the same mutex.However, the mutext has already been acquired by P1. P2 fails to obtain the mutext and waits for P1 to release mutex.Only after P1 executes the withdraw function and releases mutex, can P2 obtain mutex and continue executing.Thus, P1 cannot be interrupted by P2 when performing withdraw.

After the changes, there is no difference in concurrency between the two versions of the make-account.

The only difference is performance.If the account function is called frequently, the modified version will be faster without having to repeat the creation process.The modified version initially creates two additional serialization processes, and the make-account function initializes slightly more slowly.If the function is not called after the account is created, the serialization process still needs to be saved, which is wasted.
